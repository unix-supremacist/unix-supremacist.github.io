			<h2>ALWAYS WATCHED SUBBED NEVER DUBBED ONLY VILLANS WATCH DUBBED.</h2>
			<h2>Visual Novels</h2><p>
				hr is how long it took me to complete it.
			</p>

			<span>A Sky Full of Stars (40hr)</span><p>
				a really well written an emotional vn, really good character relationships and stories,
				technical as fuck as vns should be and will make you cry,
				probably the one id recommend the most on this list,
				amazing music as well, it's essentially a one up to IMMHW.
				though one route has some fanficy issues, which may be part poor translation.
				doesn't matter better than anything else still.
				i highly recommend reading hikaris route last.
			</p>

			<span>If My Heart Had Wings (30hr)</span><p>
				<b>INSTALL THE RETRANSLATION PATCH</b>
				a vn about creating a glider, actually decently technical,
				it's has some good emotional moments super inteligent writing,
				you will probably cry and you really will have fun,
				and was the first VN i read very good.
			</p>

			<span>Adventure of a Lifetime (7hr)</span><p>
				tiny all ages VN, great story as usual from pulltop.
			</p>

			<span>Island (21hr)</span><p>
				a really complicated VN about someone who washes up on an <i>inhabited</i> island,
				honestly great story that i don't really know how to praise without spoiling.
			</p>

			<span>Atri My Dear Moments (7hr)</span><p>
				a vn about a world with androids and where most of the world has sunken,
				inspiring and also really technical.
			</p>

			<span>The Fruit of Grisaia (130hr)</span><p>
				a vn about the protagonist Kazami Yuuji going to a very special highschool,
				there are 5 heroines with 5 routes and 2 endings per route, the game has backstories
				for all the heroines and is extremely well written, this is another thing you can
				really learn a lot from.
			</p>

			<span>The Labyrinth of Grisaia (24hr)</span><p>
				the backstory of Kazami Yuuji and afterstories for the routes in The Fruit of Grisaia,
				would recommend just as much
			</p>

			<span>The Eden of Grisaia</span><p>
				a story that ties together the plot threads of the previous Grisaia games,
				exists in a timeline where all the routes basically happened, can't recommend more.
			</p>

			<span>Grisaia Side Games (Leisure, Afterglow, Melody | 1hr each)</span><p>
				all great, but ultimately not much.
			</p>

			<span>Yukikoi Melt (30hr)</span><p>
				another frontwing VN, nothing really unique about this one honestly,
				not to say that its bad its just generic, its frontwing other than phantom trigger
				they release good products.
			</p>

			<span>Riddle Joker (70hr)</span><p>
				great VN about people with special ablities, all the routes are fairly unique and well written
			</p>

			<span>Sabbat of the Witch (60hr)</span><p>
				larger VN about witches, first yuzuge i played, and it's great.
			</p>

			<span>Senren Banka (65hr)</span><p>
				a VN about kicking ass and taking names against evil spirits.
			</p>

			<a>Dracu Riot (1r | 10hr)</a><p>
				todo
			</p>

			<span>Chrono Clock(50hr)</span><p>
				if you could go back in time 5 minutes what would you do.
			</p>

			<span>Hapymaher(75hr)</span><p>
				happy nightmares, purpleges are always good.
			</p>

			<span>Kanon (40hr)</span><p>
				classic VN not much for me to say about it as its less unique since people,
				have copied key's style, if you like clannad you'll like it.
			</p>

			<span>Clannad (90hr)</span><p>
				probably the most known VN of all times, some of the best writing, emotional highs,
				though. still a bit generic.
			</p>

			<span>Tomoyo After (15hr)</span><p>
				essentially an extension to clannad, a afterstory for tomoyo with different ends.
			</p>

			<span>Air (70hr)</span><p>
				Weakest of the key vns but not bad at all.
			</p>

			<span>Higurashi (120hr)</span><p>
				Great game series, highly inspirational, well written, and has fun mysteries.
			</p>

			<span>Fureraba Friend to Lover (24hr)</span><p>
				vn about being a chad. but no seriously good dating sim with good writing.
			</p>

			<span>Sugar Style (50hr)</span><p>
				putting the comedy into romantic comedy, i don't know how to explain it but this VN just makes me smile.
			</p>

			<a name="manga"></a>
			<h2>Manga</h2><p>
				Note Vol means how far i read, if theres no volume number it means
				i've completed it or its not done in volumes.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball</a><p>
				a fantasy martial arts, adventure, sci fi, manga that ran for over 500 chapters,
				created by akira toriyama dragon ball goes from strong kids exploring the earth,
				to battles on a galactic scale, with actual emotional story telling, and
				simplestic but honest desires and philosphies you can probably learn more from
				this manga any school.
			</p>

			<a>FullMetal Alchemist (Vol 16/27)</a><p>
				takes it self seriously in way other mangas can't, honestly probably one of the best,
				over the emotion moments, the manga basically  has everything good about both animes and more,
				without the bad, its the definitive way to consume FMA.
			</p>

			<a>One Piece (Vol 13)</a><p>
				good shonen, really well paced for how long it is, and has good writing.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Super (Ch 78)</a><p>
				Great manga, continuation to the original dragon ball and minus toriyama's,
				lack of understanding of his own time travel system, is really thought out,
				and fleshed out, other than plot points entirely different than the anime,
				and a hundred times better.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Multiverse</a><p>
				fan contiunation to the original dragonball, great manga, not as good as super
				but has clever usage of characters and their powers going for it.
			</p>

			<a>Domestic Girlfriend (Vol 1)</a><p>
				TODO: read more.
			</p>

			<a>Konosuba (Vol 11)</a><p>
				Konosuba is great ton of great jokes and general a lighthearted, but not unserious story,
				also some of the better written characters in manga.
			</p>

			<a>One Piece (Vol 18)</a><p>
				pirate adventure manga, good writing and philosphies, insanely well written inspirational, and honestly
				really intelligent, fantastic. based as hell.
			</p>

			<a>Zelda "Legendary Edition" Manga</a><p>
				the legendary editon zelda mangas are great, they are all retelling of the games stories,
				within margin of error for story telling, some changes to fit the format, really helps
				flesh out the games and is definitely not a boring read.
			</p>

			<a name="anime"></a>
			<h2>Top of the lists are the highest rating.</h2>

			<h2>Anime</h2><p>EP/S means how far i've watched, none means completed.</p>
			<a>Sakurasou</a><p>
				i don't know how to explain this anime other than,
				a ultimate inspirational slice of life.
			</p>

			<a>Neon Genesis Evangelon</a><p>
				cool "mech battle" anime, that slowly morphs into one of the most inspirational animes possible,
				honestly it's absolutely amazing 10/10
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball</a><p>
				The anime adaptation of Akira Toriyama's dragon ball is great, it takes everything about the manga,
				and adapts it perfectly into the anime format, while providing reasonable filler, that only serves
				to flesh out the world instead of waste your time.
			</p>

			<a>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)</a><p>
				FMA03 faithfully adapts the original manga until a certain point, it entirely changes the ending,
				as the anime was finished way before the manga, but overall its great, watch it before brotherhood,
				if you're watching both animes as brotherhood ruins certain points of the story that are best spoiler
				free, i recommend reading the manga however, its way better.
			</p>

			<a>Domekano</a><p>
				Seems to be a decent adaption of the manga(note to expand on this once i read the manga and add that entry)
				really great story honestly, great romance drama, but you can sort of tell the story isn't over,
				will expand upon if there is another season.
			</p>

			<a>Saekano</a><p>
				season 1 is great, season 2 is meh, anime about vn creation basically,.
			</p>

			<a>Oregairu (S 2/3)</a><p>
				great anime, inspirtation to many, don't really have that much to say.
			</p>

			<a>love and lies</a><p>
				arranged marriage based rom-com anime, based and great.
			</p>

			<a>Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!</a><p>
				funny rom-com anime, probably some of the best animation, and jokes of modern anime.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball GT</a><p>
				DBGT is a continuation of dragon ball (z if anime) by the anime team, it tries to be more akin to
				dragon balls roots instead of what it ended up being late game, ultimately ending with a mix of the
				styles, and its definitely is a must see
