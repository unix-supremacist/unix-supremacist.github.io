			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>this will be a simple no bullshit guide to installing TTW, some basic mods.</p>	
			<p>this will all be done on linux and assume you have the gog versions of the games with all dlc.</p>
				
			<p>
				this also will not be a guide to replace, say, the best of times, because i'll assume you are a
				adept computer user, and again, that you aren't using windows. though windows has very little
				differences.
			</p>

			<p>before you start the guide, run each of the games once to be sure all files are generated.</p>

			<h2>Mod Organizer and TTW</h2>
			<p>
				Mod Organizer is a tool we use to install mods, using a Virtual File System (aka VFS) to
				install mods without damaging our games installs, download the 7z from 
				<a href="https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases/latest">here</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				check out my linux gaming guide to install and configure wine if you have not
				(how the fuck did you install f3/fnv on linux without doing that?),
				then run the mo2 executable.
			</p>
			
			<p>create a portable instance, it should detect your gog install, select ttw.</p>
			
			<p>
				if it asks you where to keep the profile, put this in whatever location you want your mods
				installed to, for example mine is in <code>~/Games/TTW</code>.
			</p>
			
			<p>disable <code>FalloutNV_lang.esp</code> on the plugins tab on the right side of MO2.</p>
			
			<p>now go to the puzzle icon at the top of mo2 and open the ini editor, paste the following.</p>
			
			<code>
				<br>[General]
				<br>bUseThreadedAI=1
				<br>iNumHWThreads=2
				<br>bPreemptivelyUnloadCells=1
				<br>
				<br>[BackgroundLoad]
				<br>bBackgroundCellLoads=1
				<br>bSelectivePurgeUnusedOnFastTravel=1
				<br>
				<br>[Display]
				<br>bFull Screen=1
				<br>[Grass]
				<br>fGrassStartFadeDistance=7000
				<br>
				<br>[Controls]
				<br>fForegroundMouseAccelBase=0
				<br>fForegroundMouseAccelTop=0
				<br>fForegroundMouseBase=0
				<br>fForegroundMouseMult=0
				<br>
				<br>[Audio]
				<br>iAudioCacheSize=8192
				<br>iMaxSizeForCachedSound=1024
				<br>
				<br>[Archive]
				<br>SArchiveList=Fallout - Invalidation.bsa, Fallout - Textures.bsa, Fallout - Textures2.bsa, Fallout - Meshes.bsa, Fallout - Meshes2.bsa, Fallout - Voices1.bsa, Fallout - Sound.bsa, Fallout - Misc.bsa
			</code>
			
			<p>download ttw 3.2, 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 from <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p>extract the 3.2 to a new folder, and then extract the other updates to the same folder.</p>
			
			<p>
				open a terminal where you have the installer and run, <code>wine TTW\ Install.exe -NoOggEnc2</code>
				select the versions in order, and continue into the installer, note, you need to
				set it to install ttw, and select ttw where you put your MO2 folder, for example i had to bPreemptivelyUnloadCells
				<code>~/Games/TTW/mods/TTW/</code>, the installer is self explanatory.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				download TTW wrist fix from <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?t=8439">here</a>
				install it by the disc button on mo2, then naming it TTW to merge it into your main TTW mod.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				download NVMIM from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74295?tab=files">here</a>,
				install it as before, and also merge this mod into ttw, because it will be included in the next
				major version of ttw.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				once done, activate in mo2, boot the game with mo and test it out, TTW it self should be installed, note some audio might crackle,
				will be fixed later in the guide.

				BUT ITS UP TO THESE MOD AUTHORS TO UPLOAD ELSEWHERE.
