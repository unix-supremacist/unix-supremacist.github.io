<h1 align="center">Fear as a social control point.</h1>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;You shouldn&rsquo;t change
your behavior because a government agency somewhere is doing
the wrong thing. If we sacrifice our values because
we&rsquo;re afraid, we don&rsquo;t care about those values
very much.&quot; - Edward Snowden</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">irrational fear is used to
control everyone nowadays, even if you think your fears are
rational, most of them aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a great example of this is
catcalling it&rsquo;s been proven time and time again,
<i>most women don&rsquo;t care</i> but men are still afraid
of this, afraid to be called a predator, and let&rsquo;s
really look at what would or could happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if you cat call a girl, three
things can happen, she doesn&rsquo;t care, she likes it, or
she doesn&rsquo;t like it, lets say it&rsquo;s perfectly
even odds, more likely they like it or don&rsquo;t care in
reality though, 33/33/33% chance split, okay if 33% of them
didn&rsquo;t like it, how many of those are insane enough to
try to label you as a predator? if we said half which is
insane 16.5%, what is the chances of someone believing them?
again if we half it, which is really leaning the odds
against ourselves compared to reality. 8.25%, if we start
being more reasonable, its more likely your fucking prius
will kill you, than you being labeled a predator for cat
calling, yet you are still scared of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this isn&rsquo;t even the best
example, fear is used to control us every day, this is not
even limited to politics or anything, we are made to be
afraid of action, fear was originally a thing we had to NOT
FUCKING DIE, and nothing we are afraid of now, would kill
us, or even hurt us in the long run, day to day you probably
don&rsquo;t talk to someone because you are scared, OF WHAT.
simply all fear is doing is perventing us from moving
forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">what is a prodigy? someone
innately born with a talent? bullshit. a prodigy is someone
who picks one thing, takes action, sticks with it, and
always continues taking action. there is no such thing as an
innate talent, in fact more and more things seem to prove
enviroment after birth has more to do with development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">why would someone want us to not
take action? what would be the point of that? to keep
control, if we are always paralyzed how can we ever fight
something controlling us? we are being
&rsquo;medicated&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other methods than fear are also
used, dopamine addiction and general drug addiction is
common, so is false information and the &quot;learn nothing
school system&quot; as i&rsquo;d call it, simply society is
designed to <i>impede personal progression</i> and that
doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s going to stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so just do whatever the fuck you
want and stop being afraid, the fear is not going to help
you do anything.</p>
