<p style="margin-top: 1em">i guess we should begin with
what started this story, there is going to be a port of
tinker&rsquo;s construct for fabric soon, which i am happy
about, the fact is however, the port is obviously of 1.18
tinker&rsquo;s. i haven&rsquo;t used tinker&rsquo;s since
1.12 so booted it up to take a look.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i was filled with immense
disappointment, it&rsquo;s even less like the tinker&rsquo;s
i know and love which is saying a lot after what happened
with 1.8.9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">they&rsquo;ve removed drying
racks, the tool forge, added a assload of slime items, and
in general just generified the entire mod, this is on top of
what was already removed in 1.8, oreberries, gravel ores,
overworld ores in general, this isn&rsquo;t even
tinker&rsquo;s anymore, it doesn&rsquo;t have tinker&rsquo;s
soul</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you might be thinking, well
modders want to do something different, content changes, ok
fair but you have to understand, this is making the mod
<i>more generic</i> anvils instead of toolforges? no drying
racks? a ton of items made in slime when they couldve had
any new idea for a material, or reintroduced any old idea?
no the mod is becoming more generic as time goes on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">now all that is gone for a
overpowered tools mod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and it won&rsquo;t be the
last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the details anymore,
gregtech2-4, thermal expansion, ender io, mekanism,
forestry, railcraft, just to name a few, how about we go
over some of these.</p>

<h2>2. Thermal Expansion and Ender IO
<a name="2. Thermal Expansion and Ender IO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thermal Expansion in 1.4.7 was a
essential, people used it for ore processing, gregtech users
used it for automating their factories, and in 1.7.10,
thermal grew, there was more machines, more ways to
automate, more difficult crafting, long story short, it only
got better until that point, and then 1.8 happened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slow update times, basically
1.7.10 was the longest modded version of minecraft, and
porting to later versions almost always required rewrites,
or heavy refactoring this included thermal and ender io.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plus they removed their unqiue
tiered machine frame crafting system, well more unique than
what replaced it, for gregtech2 style plate crafting, in
general, the mod had less content, was easier, and
overlapped more with ic2, gt, and immersive, making it well,
there isn&rsquo;t anything here thats no other tech mod has
in 1.12, and that sucks for one of the most inspiring tech
mods this game has ever had, and a mod i used to love to
play with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glass blocks with a ton of block
states that destroies memory usage, or adding stone machines
that are just grindy to craft and are weaker versions of
what already existed a little bit more QA would&rsquo;ve
went a long way.</p>

<h2>3. Gregtech
<a name="3. Gregtech"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">gregtech is a progression based
tech mod that is designed around building large factories,
it took off in 1.4.7, and people slowly started liking it
less in the mainstream as the mod got harder and larger over
1.5-1.7, however everything changed when the fire nation
attacked, in 1.7.10 during the development of gt5, which to
be fair even it had issues but it still hadn&rsquo;t fallen
as far as other mods we&rsquo;ve talked about at this point,
was discontinued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the people who moved to the new
versions, and the people who stayed with gt5, which lead to
a fork of gt5 known as gt5u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">made it more generic and easier,
gtce, well was incomplete and had a mix of the tech reborn
and gt5u issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this is another case that we
really need solved.</p>

<h2>4. End Notes
<a name="4. End Notes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">tedious to read, i just really
wish i didn&rsquo;t have to play 1.7.10 to get thermal
expansion like i remember it, or gt, or any arbitary mod,
which is why, i plan to rewrite 1.7.10 thermal for modern
fabric at some point, and i hope people start understanding
what makes their mods unique and stop ruining them, and i
fucking want redpower2 back :(</p>
