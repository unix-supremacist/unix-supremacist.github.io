<h2>Freedom
<a name="Freedom"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-Free software has been the
bane of every nerds existance, boycott non free
software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you do not need to use microsoft
edge, photoshop, microsoft office, windows, or any
propieritary malware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it&rsquo;s entirely unnecessary,
and while yes, there is propieritary blobs in linux, theres
propieritary nvidia drivers you may have to use, it&rsquo;s
still miles better than an completely propieritary system or
workflow.</p>

<h2>Youtube
<a name="Youtube"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Youtube is a shitty platform ran
by shitty people, they constantly attack projects like
invidious, YT-DL, while also constantly banning creators
that haven&rsquo;t violated their rules, because they
don&rsquo;t know their own rules, they also ban creators
like bosskwar and the weebathon, seemingly for no reason, i
assume &quot;OH BUT ANIME IS FOR KIDS&quot; bullshit youtube
types preach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">odysee is great and (as far as i
know, apologies for lack of researching this), is completely
free software, rumble is propieritary, and commericalized,
but is atleast better than youtube.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">both of these are fine
alternatives, theres no reason not to use them, theres even
bravenewpipe to watch youtube and rumble on the same
app.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Continuning to watch creators on
youtube when they are elsewhere is outright immoral.</p>

<h2>Amazon/Twitch
<a name="Amazon/Twitch"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">amazon and twitch is filled with
some of the most politically biased, and untrustworthy
people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you can see this with what
happened with twitch, curseforge, and what is still
happening now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">twitch continues to remove the
freedom of users, and creators to try to overcome youtube,
the multistream ban is apart of this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">why anyone would stream on
twitch after this, and the constant censorship, to the point
where you can&rsquo;t talk about &quot;simps&quot; or a
transmission of a car, is impossible to me to
understand.</p>

<h2>Reddit
<a name="Reddit"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">To anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know
the original creator of reddit and his story, he was a great
man, you can find info online, but i can&rsquo;t be arsed to
rehearse it here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the platform is by far no longer
in his image, back in the day, it was basically less
anonymous 4chan, nowadays its filled with more censorship
than even twitch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">combine this with the way they
are doing apis, making it even harder for normal people to
use, and there&rsquo;s no reason for its continued use.</p>

<h2>Twitter
<a name="Twitter"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Twitter is arguably less of a
botted hellhole since musk took over, but undenably
it&rsquo;s a fucking mess, still propieritary, and theres no
reason to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mastodon and other federated
social media platforms can easily replace it.</p>

<h2>Facebook
<a name="Facebook"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-top: 1em">https://stallman.org/facebook.html
(i know the link is broken)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i have nothing to say about this
that hasn&rsquo;t already been said.</p>

<h2>Discord
<a name="Discord"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">discord is a garbage platform
that not only has <i>everything single issue of every
platform above</i> but also has rampet p*dophiles, as well
as a history of unhinged moderation teams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discord is the worst offender on
this list, and the hardest to leave, because of the amount
of people that use it, and how you likely have friends on
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use matrix, xmpp, irc, etc.</p>

<h2>Everything
<a name="Everything"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">every platform sucks,
decentralization and free software is the key, to keeping
the internet, well free.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boycott every platform that does
anything to screw you over, and any time you can use free
software over propieritary software do it.</p>

<h2>MY PLATFORM DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE!
<a name="MY PLATFORM DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE!"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">there&rsquo;s a solution to this
problem, touch grass, if you think you can&rsquo;t deal
without an online platform, speed more time in real
life.</p>
