adding these as non steam games should just work, just click the add a game button in steam and you're off

polymc

```yay pacman -S polymc-qt5-bin```

i installed `dracu-riot!` from my nas into a folder in `~/Games` and added it as a non steam game
i ran these commands to install proton ge, note you will want to update these for the latest build
```wget https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/GE-Proton8-25/GE-Proton8-25.tar.gz```
```mkdir ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d```
```tar -xf GE-Proton8-25.tar.gz -C ~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/```
```rm GE-Proton8-25.tar.gz```
to get it working i needed to click enable steam play for all other titles in `settings>compatiblitity` on steam
and changed run other titles with, to the ge-proton i just installed.
then after adding it as a non steam game, going to the compatiblity tab and checking force the use of a specific steam play compatibility tool
now the reason i started with dracu-riot is it needs a japanese locale so add `LANG=ja_JP.UTF8 %command%` to the launch options
then start the game, some specific games do not like fullscreen in wayland, dracu-riot is one of them,
so you have to navigate the bar menu to disable fullscreen close the game, and reopen it
